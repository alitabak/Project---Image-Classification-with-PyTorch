# Project: Image Classification with PyTorch

# Insight:

This project includes 5 different modelling approaches for image classification problem with CIFAR100 data-set and demonstrates how the power of the models increase as they become deeper, the project is prepared as the course project of Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs online certification course.
