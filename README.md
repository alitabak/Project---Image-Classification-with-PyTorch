# Project: Image Classification with PyTorch

# Insight:

This project includes 5 different modelling approaches for image classification problem with CIFAR100 data-set and demonstrates how the power of the models increase as they become deeper, the project is prepared as the course project of Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs online certification course.

P.S.: 1) For more details, references, and sources please also see the blog post. 
      2) Here the codes are from the source code, which is provided during the lectures by the course instructor and Jovian.ml. The detailed codes also can be found in the lecture notebooks from the course instructor and jovian.ml. Please visit the course website from Jovian.ml, in order to access for more detailed codes.
